Guide to Development
=========================
Welcome to HiCoin open platform. Based on HiCoin’s huge user traffic and secure BlockChain wallet architecture, this platform provides powerful payment functions and user resources to third-party partners through various interfaces, which enables partners to connect more applications and make them more competitive in the market. We also hope to apply BlockChain technology to more fields.

This documentation resource aims to help developers successfully connect to the HiCoin platform. In the future, we will assist you in three major aspects: 1) authorization; 2) payment from users; 3) payment to merchants.
