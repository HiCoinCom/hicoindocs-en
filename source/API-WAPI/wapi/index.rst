Custody WAPI Documentation
==============================================

Welcome to the HiCoin asset custody platform. This document is used by the third-party technical team to add the self-developed mainchain to the WaaS Alliance for alliance members.

Note: How to use WAPI to access the mainchain, the server and private keys are kept by the third-party technical team, and the WaaS Alliance is not responsible for the security of assets. Therefore, the third-party technical team must establish a complete wallet private key custody system and API private key custody system.
